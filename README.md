# Analysis, visualization, and synaptic downscaling of neuron-type specific CA3 SNNs that can form and retrieve cell assemblies
This repository includes [MATLAB](https://github.com/jkopsick/cell_assembly_formation_retrieval/tree/main/matlab_analysis_visualization_code) code that was utilized for analysis of a full-scale spiking neural network (SNN) model of hippocampal subregion CA3, which formed and retrieved patterns via cell assemblies. Additionally, it contains MATLAB code for visualizing the activity of this SNN when patterns were formed and retrieved, [MATLAB](https://github.com/jkopsick/cell_assembly_formation_retrieval/tree/main/matlab_figure_creation_code) and [Python](https://github.com/jkopsick/cell_assembly_formation_retrieval/tree/main/python_figure_creation_code) code to generate pertinent figures of the manuscript, and [Python](https://github.com/jkopsick/cell_assembly_formation_retrieval/tree/main/python_normalization_code) code for the synaptic downscaling of the synaptic weights between Pyramidal cells. Furthermore, the data to create the figures in MATLAB and Python can be found [here](https://zenodo.org/records/10870586). The code contained here is compatible with output files generated from CA3 SNNs simulated in CARLsim 6; instructions for downloading the Hippocampome-CARLsim 6 software that was utilized to simulate the CA3 SNNs is listed in this [README](https://github.com/jkopsick/CARLsim6/tree/feat/CS6_hc_ca3/projects).
